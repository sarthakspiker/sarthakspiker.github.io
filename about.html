 <p style="font-size:22px;padding:30px;padding-left:50px;">
I like travelling, I've fell quite a few times though not once broke a bone. I like non-veg food specially chicken.
I love music a lot. At age of 15, I came to know what I had to do in my life and I had finally found
 my passion. I play lot of mobile games and mess with softwares. I read many things on the Internet, and also follow various forums.

  <h2 style="padding:20px;padding-top:30px;font-size:30px;text-align:center;"> The Origin</h2>
 <p style="font-size:22px;padding:30px;padding-left:50px;">
I grew up in a very small town (Hisua) of India. Its a remote area close to Rajgir region, in Bihar. Due
to lack of resources i was not able to learn many things that i wanted to, in the initial years. Later
on, with the arrival of INTERET OF THINGS, I got a chance to learn a few things and soon I knew my passion.
Then I started digging articles on various websites and learned development. In 2012 I joined XDA and since
then I've not stopped. I learned things about Android from the Internet and I'm also maintaining some projects.
